# MITM_Attack_Project

A MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attack and ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) spoofing project involves exploiting network vulnerabilities to intercept, manipulate, and potentially inject data into communications between devices on a local network. This project demonstrates how attackers can perform these types of attacks and highlights the importance of securing networks.

Project Description: MITM Attack and ARP Spoofing
Objective:
The goal of this project is to understand and implement a Man-in-the-Middle attack using ARP spoofing techniques on a local network. The attacker will intercept communications between two devices (victim devices), read and modify data, and potentially inject malicious content into the communication. The project also aims to demonstrate countermeasures to prevent such attacks.

Components:
Understanding ARP and MITM Attacks:

ARP is a protocol used for mapping IP addresses to MAC addresses in a local network.
ARP spoofing (or poisoning) is an attack in which an attacker sends fake ARP messages onto the network, associating the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate device (like the gateway or another victim device).
A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack occurs when the attacker is positioned between two communicating devices, allowing them to intercept and manipulate the communication.
Setup and Tools:

Network Setup: The project requires a local network with at least three devices: an attacker, a victim, and a gateway/router.
Tools: Common tools used in MITM attacks and ARP spoofing are:
Wireshark: For network monitoring and sniffing.
Ettercap: For performing ARP spoofing and MITM attacks.
Scapy: A Python-based tool for network packet manipulation.
Cain & Abel (optional): A Windows-based tool for ARP poisoning.
Implementation Steps:

ARP Spoofing Setup:
The attacker sends spoofed ARP packets to both the victim and the gateway, falsely claiming to be the other.
This causes both devices to update their ARP tables, directing traffic meant for the gateway through the attacker.
MITM Attack:
Once the attacker is positioned between the two devices, they can intercept, modify, or inject packets into the communication.
The attacker can log sensitive information like usernames and passwords or alter the content being sent.
Demonstration of Vulnerabilities:

Show how the attacker can capture sensitive data (e.g., login credentials) from unencrypted communications (HTTP instead of HTTPS).
Manipulate network traffic, like injecting fake web pages or redirecting the victim to a malicious website.
Countermeasures:

Static ARP Entries: Prevent ARP spoofing by manually assigning static ARP entries to devices.
Packet Filtering: Use firewalls or intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to detect suspicious ARP packets.
Encryption: Ensure that sensitive data is encrypted using protocols like HTTPS, SSH, and VPNs to protect against MITM attacks.
Ethical Considerations:

This project should only be performed on a controlled, isolated network where you have permission to test these techniques.
Demonstrating MITM and ARP spoofing should be done responsibly and with ethical guidelines, ensuring that the knowledge is used for improving network security.
Learning Outcomes:
Understanding how ARP works in network communication.
Gaining insight into the vulnerabilities of local networks and how attackers exploit them.
Learning how to implement a basic MITM attack using ARP spoofing.
Recognizing the importance of securing networks against ARP spoofing and MITM attacks.
